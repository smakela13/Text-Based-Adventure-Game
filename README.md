## Ideas

Definitely want to incorporate this type of movement into the game: 
   "You are in a dark room. There is a door to your right and left."
   "Which one do you take?"

   Other ideas:
   - Make the enemy health greater than 25 as a base state
   - Have different player classes
   - Allow player to level up
   - Allow player to choose a weapon
   - Incorporate different enemy stats based on their names/types
   - Introduce different locations for the player to travel to in the city
   - Continue to refine the game's text format
   - Add a story line
   - Add colors to the console text
